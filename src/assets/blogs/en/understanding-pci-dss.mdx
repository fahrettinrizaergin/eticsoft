# What is PCI-DSS? Understanding Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards

## Introduction to PCI-DSS

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security requirements designed to ensure that ALL companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. This global standard was created by major credit card brands including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB International.

## Why is PCI-DSS Important?

The importance of PCI-DSS compliance stems from several critical factors:
- Protection of sensitive cardholder data
- Prevention of data breaches and fraud
- Maintenance of customer trust
- Avoidance of significant financial penalties
- Adherence to global security standards

## Core Requirements of PCI-DSS

### 1. Build and Maintain a Secure Network
- Install and maintain a firewall configuration
- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords

### 2. Protect Cardholder Data
- Protect stored cardholder data
- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open networks

### 3. Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program
- Use and regularly update anti-virus software
- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications

### 4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures
- Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know
- Identify and authenticate access to system components
- Restrict physical access to cardholder data

### 5. Regularly Monitor and Test Networks
- Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data
- Regularly test security systems and processes

### 6. Maintain an Information Security Policy
- Maintain a policy that addresses information security

## Compliance Levels

PCI-DSS has four compliance levels based on transaction volume:

1. **Level 1**
   - Over 6 million transactions annually
   - Annual onsite audit required
   - Quarterly network scan

2. **Level 2**
   - 1 to 6 million transactions annually
   - Annual self-assessment
   - Quarterly network scan

3. **Level 3**
   - 20,000 to 1 million transactions annually
   - Annual self-assessment
   - Quarterly network scan

4. **Level 4**
   - Less than 20,000 transactions annually
   - Annual self-assessment
   - Quarterly network scan
