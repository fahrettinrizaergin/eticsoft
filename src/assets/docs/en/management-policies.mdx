In accordance with the transparency principle and to maintain the high quality standard in its products and services, it publishes these documents publicly. You can access the latest version of the referenced documents from the table below.

While preparing and updating these documents, EticSoft utilizes industrial standards, scientific sources, customer feedback, EticSoft employees' feedback, legal texts in legislation, and recommendations from business partners. If you have any recommendations or questions about these documents, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Please pay attention to the following points:

* Each document has a publication date and documents may be updated in future dates. If your communication preferences are not set to receive update notifications when the document is updated or if your contact information is not available, EticSoft may not be able to inform you.

* Since EticSoft is an international company and may operate with different companies for different regions; some procedures and policies may vary according to the provider company, the location where the product/service is supplied, or the customer's location.
