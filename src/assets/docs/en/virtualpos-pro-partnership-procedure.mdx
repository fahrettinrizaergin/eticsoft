## Basic Principles EticSoft Will Consider in Cooperation Process

* Proposals for sharing user information or users' commercial information for sales marketing activities created by an institution wanting to cooperate targeting existing VirtualPOS PRO! users with competing stakeholders are rejected.

* In case of suspicion of violation of relevant legislation such as competition law, personal data protection law and banking law concerning cooperation process, process is terminated or additional commitments may be requested from institution.

* Institution wanting to cooperate must commit to providing a cooperation-specific communication channel and technical infrastructure that will maintain current customer satisfaction rate throughout process.

* Since relevant product (VirtualPOS PRO!) is developed by EticSoft, contracts regarding use of this product are also prepared by EticSoft and presented to all stakeholders in standard form. EticSoft does not sign different integrator contracts prepared by institutions on their side. Can make stakeholder-specific changes in standard contract.

* EticSoft does not allow any cooperating institution to access usage statistics and cooperation information of other institutions that are its competitors.

* While this cooperation process is open to all banking/finance institutions, realization of a cooperation is possible if EticSoft evaluates and approves relevant institution and its services in terms of commercial, ethical or technical aspects.
