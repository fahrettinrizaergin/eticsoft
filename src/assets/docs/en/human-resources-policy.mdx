# Human Resources Policy

## Human Resources Planning Policy

* Work to increase current personnel's working time, quality of life, and ultimately productivity in our company.
* Identify qualified human resources needed for our company's R&D and commercial goals.
* Create necessary financial, environmental, and physical plans to spend on acquiring human resources.
* Plan recruitment processes to ensure finding the most suitable candidate to join our colleagues.

## Recruitment Procedure

* Clear recruitment advertisements are prepared and publicly published to reach potential colleague candidates.
* Other employees' opinions in the relevant work area are taken before creating the advertisement.
* No prerequisites are set for candidate applications. All applications are evaluated together. Applications that don't meet advertisement conditions can be eliminated after acceptance.
* Resumes can be sent to our company without any advertisement. Necessary forms and links are publicly displayed.
* Candidates' religion, ethnicity, native language, gender, sexual orientation/preference, dress style, and physical appearance characteristics are never subject to selection criteria; candidates are preferred to send resumes without photographs.
* Candidates who pass the recruitment process start official employment as "candidate employees" for a period between one to 12 months.
* Candidate employee's social insurance registration starts on or one day before their start date.

## Training and Personal Development Policy Principles

* Employees are encouraged to take training for personal and/or professional development.
* Reasonable accommodations (part-time work, remote work, changing workdays) are provided to employees who want to study at formal educational institutions to continue their current duties during their education.
* Internal training is organized for employees to increase their efficiency in their fields. These training plans are made by the board of directors, and training costs, if any, are covered by the company budget. Employees are encouraged to provide training presentations, talks, and periodic courses to other employees on a voluntary basis.
* Participation in educational activities that contribute to employee development is encouraged, particularly in information security, foreign languages, technical, engineering, and marketing fields.

## Productivity, Continuity, and Motivation Policy

* The primary task of our company's human resources policy is to provide a low-stress environment, employee-favored optimized productive working hours, highest possible professional development, and professional satisfaction for employees to obtain "quality time."
* The "quality time" principle is applied not only during working hours but also considering non-working hours. In this context, preventing unnecessary extension of working hours, facilitating access to rest/vacation leave periods appropriate to work intensity, and working without overtime except in critical situations are ensured to allow employees more time for family and social life.
* Electronic work environments, electronic communication, and control mechanisms are provided to develop and preferably enable "remote working culture" for independence from physical environment.
* One-on-one meetings are held with all company employees at least once a year to gather their views on expectations, productivity improvement suggestions, career goals, experienced difficulties, etc., which are presented to the board of directors in anonymized form. Studies are conducted on these results.
* Employees are encouraged to access social, scientific, and artistic activities at maximum level. Such activities are subject to working hours arrangement.
* Employees are advised to adopt active behaviors like self-control, volunteerism, taking initiative instead of remaining passive in the instruction and control cycle. Active behaviors are used as arguments in performance measurement and reward processes.
* Employees -regardless of position- are encouraged to provide intellectual/strategic contributions for any project/work plan.
* When employees' emotional states are seen as unsuitable for productive work, they are facilitated to use excuse leave and/or unpaid leave. In such situations, maximum attention is paid to the employee's right to hide their excuse according to legislation, following the principle of privacy.

## Hierarchy, Title, and Communication Principles

In our company, regardless of employees' duty and position (including chairman of the board)

* Commanding tone, loud voice, or aggressive verbal/written communication,
* Communication written in all capital letters,
* Communication established using personal information without consent outside company communication channels (from social networks, etc.),
* Communication without consent outside working days and hours except for predetermined situations like disaster recovery scenarios,
* Any aggressive, impolite, passive-aggressive behaviors in work areas,
* Social, economic, psychological pressure (mobbing) on colleagues

are strictly prohibited and defined as disciplinary offenses to be investigated without need for complaint.

* Our company employees' duties and responsibilities are organized according to hierarchy of duties principles. This hierarchical model is established between duties, not between employees.
* Employee job titles are determined by the board of directors. An employee may have multiple titles when they have multiple duties simultaneously. Employees cannot use titles other than those determined.
* Creating hierarchical relationships between people outside of duty hierarchy, classifications based on employee age, education, or seniority is prohibited.

## Compensation Policy and Procedure

* Our company's income and expenses are kept completely transparent and "accessible to all employees." Employee salaries are determined by the board of directors. Arguments such as current employees' opinions, sector salary statistics, and macroeconomic parameters are used in the salary determination process.
* Extraordinary performance, significant achievements, and exemplary behaviors during employees' duties are specially evaluated and rewarded by the board of directors.
* Employees' transportation and meal expenses are covered entirely or at the highest possible rate by our company.
* Except for candidate employees, all employees are employed with predetermined salaries. Employee salaries are determined by the board of directors according to job qualifications before the recruitment process and budgeted by adding to the annual personnel expenses financial plan.
* The board of directors can make multiple salary increases within the year when there are extraordinary developments in national and global economic conditions.
* Similar pay for similar work policy is applied in our company. The exception to this policy is a direct proportional relationship between the employee's previous working time (seniority) and their salary.
* Our company has an "income sharing model" for sharing net profit with employees. The conditions and mathematical model of this model are determined by the board of directors each year, added to the financial planning of the relevant year, and announced to employees.
* A portion of our company's quarterly revenues, predetermined by the board of directors, is allocated as a budget whose spending method will be freely determined by "all employees except board member employees, with unanimous vote" on the condition that it is spent on developing work areas.

All employees and managers of EticSoft Information Technologies Inc. are obligated to act in accordance with this policy.
