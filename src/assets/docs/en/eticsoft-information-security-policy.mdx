# EticSoft Information Security Policy

## Rationale
EticSoft possesses information assets created by its employees, business partners, and customers. It is necessary to identify any intentional or unintentional threats to these assets and define the risks these threats may pose, as well as determine and manage processes related to protecting the confidentiality, accessibility, and structure of these assets.

## Purpose
The General Information Security Policy aims to establish principles for identifying threats to EticSoft's information assets, preventive measures and implementation processes, and business continuity throughout this process.

## Scope
While the General Information Security Policy serves as the top reference for all information security-related processes, a special information security policy can be created specifically for any product, service, customer group, location, or project when deemed necessary.

## Implementation and Management
An EticSoft Information Security Board consisting of three members is established to update and periodically review the information security policy, meeting at least twice a year. Meetings are recorded with minutes. The EticSoft Information Security Board is responsible for evaluating and executing policy items and related regulations one by one.
